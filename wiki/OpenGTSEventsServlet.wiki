For this software to work with OpenGTS server, Events servlet must be tweaked and deplyed.

Events should be able to return the number of devices an user is able to read and the names for that devices in fleet.

}}}

4,car1,tracker2,mytracker,car2

4 - number of devices

tracker2 - second device
 
etc
